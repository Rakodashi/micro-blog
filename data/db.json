      "body": "Jean-Luc Picard was a celebrated Starfleet officer, archaeologist, writer, historian, diplomat, and philanthropist, who served throughout much of the 24th century. The highlights of his career were centered around assignments as commanding officer of the Federation starships USS Stargazer, USS Enterprise-D, and the USS Enterprise-E. In these roles, Picard not only witnessed major turning points of recent galactic history, but played a key role in them also, from making first contact as captain of the Federations flagship with no fewer than 27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg. His successful contact with the Children of Tama resulted in his name being incorporated into the Tamarian language through the metaphor 'Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel'.",

Twenty-four years later, Seven, as she was later known, was liberated from life as a Borg drone by the crew of the USS Voyager and joined the crew under Captain Janeway's mentorship. She was critical in assisting the crew's return to the Alpha Quadrant in 2378.\n\nSeven was initially rejected by Starfleet for her Borg past, and chose instead to join the Fenris Rangers, helping instill justice in lawless and dangerous regions. Instrumental in the forging of a truce with a new Borg faction, she was given a field commission by Admiral Picard and joined Starfleet as a commander and first officer of the USS Titan-A. Following the destruction of the Borg, Seven was promoted to the rank of captain and given command of the USS Enterprise-G. ",
