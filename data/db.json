Twenty-four years later, Seven, as she was later known, was liberated from life as a Borg drone by the crew of the USS Voyager and joined the crew under Captain Janeway's mentorship. She was critical in assisting the crew's return to the Alpha Quadrant in 2378.\n\nSeven was initially rejected by Starfleet for her Borg past, and chose instead to join the Fenris Rangers, helping instill justice in lawless and dangerous regions. Instrumental in the forging of a truce with a new Borg faction, she was given a field commission by Admiral Picard and joined Starfleet as a commander and first officer of the USS Titan-A. Following the destruction of the Borg, Seven was promoted to the rank of captain and given command of the USS Enterprise-G. ",

      "body": "Jean-Luc Picard was a celebrated Starfleet officer, archaeologist, writer, historian, diplomat, and philanthropist, who served throughout much of the 24th century. The highlights of his career were centered around assignments as commanding officer of the Federation starships USS Stargazer, USS Enterprise-D, and the USS Enterprise-E. In these roles, Picard not only witnessed major turning points of recent galactic history, but played a key role in them also, from making first contact as captain of the Federation's flagship with no fewer than 27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg. His successful contact with the Children of Tama resulted in his name being incorporated into the Tamarian language through the metaphor \"Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel\".\n\nHe also became the chief contact point with the Q Continuum, and served as Arbiter of Succession of the Klingon Empire, where he presided over the investiture of Klingon Chancellor Gowron. Picard would expose the Romulan Star Empire as backers of Gowron's chief rivals, later aiding a Romulan underground movement of dissidents to gain a toehold on the Romulan homeworld. He continued to serve as captain of the Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation starship to bear the name, until at least the early 2380s. (TNG: \"The Battle\", \"The Last Outpost\", \"Q Who\", \"Darmok\", \"Encounter at Farpoint\", and more, \"Redemption\", \"Redemption II\", \"Unification II\"; Star Trek: First Contact; Star Trek Nemesis; PIC: \"Remembrance\")\n\nFollowing his command of the Enterprise-E, he rose to the rank of admiral, he resigned from Starfleet for a time, after he felt that the organization had strayed from its ideals, before eventually rejoining as the Chancellor of Starfleet Academy.",

      "body": "Deanna Troi was a female Betazoidâ€“Human hybrid Starfleet officer. Under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, she served as the counselor aboard the USS Enterprise-D and the USS Enterprise-E. In 2379, Troi transferred to the USS Titan (Star Trek: The Next Generation; Star Trek Nemesis). By 2399, she and her husband William T. Riker lived on the planet Nepenthe with their daughter, Kestra Troi-Riker. Their son, Thaddeus Troi-Riker, died of Mendaxic neurosclerosis soon after their arrival on Nepenthe. (PIC: \"Nepenthe\")\n\nAs a half-Betazoid, Troi was capable of extra-sensory empathy, but was incapable of reading aliens with brain structures dissimilar to Humans and other Betazoids, such as the Breen and the Ferengi. Like most Betazoids, Troi had telepathic abilities. Due to her half-Human heritage, however, the range of her telepathic abilities was limited compared to full-blooded Betazoids, and she could usually only read the thoughts of other Betazoids, most notably her mother. Troi's empathic skills made her an important asset to the Enterprise-D and her abilities were often particularly useful when dealing with hostile races. Since she could usually determine, through use of her abilities, whether others were lying, she repeatedly proved herself invaluable in many suspenseful situations.",
